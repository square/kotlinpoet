Hear Ye
==========

Hear Ye is a fork of the amazing [KotlinPoet](https://square.github.io/kotlinpoet)

Unfortunately, their maintainers have a square-ly 😏 annoying take on inheritance and extensibility.

To which we say... you can go your own wayyyy, go your own way 🎵

Eventually, `hear-ye` will be hard forked and merged with Poetik, to create the dream Kotlin generator that Backbone deserves
