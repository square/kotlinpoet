Contributing
============

If you would like to contribute code you can do so through GitHub by forking
the repository and sending a pull request.

When submitting code, please make every effort to follow existing conventions
and style in order to keep the code as readable as possible. Please also make
sure your code compiles by running `./gradlew clean build`.

When creating a pull request, please add a row in the [changelog][2] with the
patch description and PR # to `Unreleased` section.

Before your code can be accepted into the project you must also sign the
[Individual Contributor License Agreement (CLA)][1].
