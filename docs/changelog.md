## Version 1.17.0

Thanks to [@jisungbin][jisungbin], [@hfhbd][hfhbd], [@evant][evant], [@sgjesse][sgjesse], [@sebek64][sebek64] for
contributing to this release.

_2024-05-24_

* Change: kotlinx-metadata 0.9.0. Note that the `KotlinClassMetadata.read` is deprecated in 0.9.0 and replaced with
  `readStrict` (#1830).
  * Note: we now also provide `lenient` parameters to map to the underlying `readStrict()` and `readLenient()` calls
    (#1766).
  * We have also removed various `Class`/`TypeElement`/`Metadata`-to-`KmClass` APIs from the public API, as these are
    trivial to write now with kotlinx-metadata's newer APIs and allows us to focus the API surface area of this artifact
    better (#1891).
* New: Supertype list wraps to one-per-line if the primary constructor spans multiple lines (#1866).
* New: Extract `MemberSpecHolder` interface for constructs that can hold `PropertySpec`s and `FunSpec`s and their
  builders (#1877).
* New: `joinToCode` variant which operates on any type, but requires a transform lambda to convert each element into a
  `CodeBlock` (#1874).
* New: Support annotation type arguments in `KSAnnotation.toAnnotationSpec()` (#1889).
* Fix: Prevent name clashes between a function in class and a function call in current scope (#1850).
* Fix: Fix extension function imports (#1814).
* Fix: Omit implicit modifiers on `FileSpec.scriptBuilder` (#1813).
* Fix: Fix trailing newline in `PropertySpec` (#1827).
* Fix: `KSAnnotation.toAnnotationSpec` writes varargs in place instead of making them an array to work around a Kotlin
  issue with `OptIn` annotations (#1833).
* Fix: `MemberName`s without a package are now correctly imported (#1841)
* Fix: Throw if primary constructor delegates to other constructors (#1859).
* Fix: Aliased imports with nested class (#1876).
* Fix: Check for error types in `KSType.toClassName()` (#1890).
* Fix: Support generating a single import for overloaded `MemberName`s (#1909).

## Version 1.16.0

 * Fix: Fix a regression introduced by #1637, where a superfluous newline is added to a type's KDoc
 if it has a primary constructor with no docs (#1727).

## Version 1.15.0

_2023-11-18_

Thanks to [@drawers][drawers], [@fejesjoco][fejesjoco], [@takahirom][takahirom],
[@martinbonnin][martinbonnin], [@mcarleio][mcarleio] for contributing to this release.

In this release the `:kotlinpoet` module has been converted to a Kotlin Multiplatform module
(#1654), though for now it only supports the JVM target. **Important**: unless you're building
with Gradle, you will now need to depend on the `kotlinpoet-jvm` artifact, instead of `kotlinpoet` -
see [Downloads](index.md#download) for instructions.

 * New: Kotlin 1.9.20.
 * New: KSP 1.9.20-1.0.14.
 * New: Extract `TypeSpecHolder` interface for constructs that can hold a TypeSpec and their builders (#1723).
 * New: Expose relative path from `FileSpec` (#1720).
 * New: Return the generated path from `FileSpec.writeTo()`. (#1514).
 * New: Remove default compatibility from unstable types (#1662).
 * New: Deprecate `TypeSpec.expectClassBuilder()` and `TypeSpec.valueClassBuilder()` (#1589).
 * New: Add option to convert `KSAnnotation` to `AnnotationSpec` while omitting default values (#1538).
 * New: Add `FileSpec.builder` convenience for `MemberName` (#1585).
 * Fix: Set `DecimalFormatSymbols.minusSign` for consistency across locales (#1658).
 * Fix: Fix link to incremental KSP in KDoc (#1638).
 * Fix: Emit primary constructor KDoc (#1637).
 * Change: kotlinx-metadata 0.7.0. This is a breaking change for users of the `:kotlinpoet-metadata`
   module, as most `Flags`-API extensions have been removed in favor of the now-available first-party versions.

## Version 1.14.2

_2023-05-30_

 * Fix: Fix one more missing API in binary compatibility override in `Annotatable.Builder` (#1581).

## Version 1.14.1

_2023-05-29_

 * Fix: Restore ABI stability for annotatable and documentable builders (#1580).

## Version 1.14.0

_2023-05-29_

Thanks to [@Omico][Omico], [@drawers][drawers], [@RBusarow][RBusarow] for contributing to this release.

 * New: Kotlin 1.8.21.
 * New: KSP 1.8.21-1.0.11.
 * New: Enable default methods in Java bytecode (#1561).
 * New: Group Kotlin and Renovate updates together in Renovate (#1562).
 * New: Extract trait interface for annotatable constructs and their builders (#1564).
 * New: Extract trait interface for documentable constructs and their builders (#1571).
 * New: Document the usage of `STAR` (#1572).
 * New: Add builder for `FunSpec` which accepts a `MemberName` (#1574).
 * Fix: Omit public modifier on override function or constructor parameters (#1550).
 * Fix: Correct handling of members in various types (#1558).
 * Fix: Function return types now default to `Unit` unless explicitly set (#1559).

    Previously, when `FunSpec` didn't have a return type specified and an expression body was produced, no return
    type would be emitted. However, starting from `1.14.0`, KotlinPoet will not add `Unit` as a return type in such
    cases. In order to correct the generated output, you are to specify the actual return type of the `FunSpec`.

    Before `1.14.0`, if omitted, no return type is produced:
    ```kotlin
    val funSpec = FunSpec.builder("foo")
      .addStatement("return 1")
      .build()
    ```
    ```kotlin
    public fun foo() = 1
    ```

    From `1.14.0`, the return type defaults to `Unit` if not otherwise set:
    ```kotlin
    val funSpec = FunSpec.builder("foo")
      .addStatement("return 1")
      .build()
    ```
    ```kotlin
    public fun foo(): Unit = 1 // ❌
    ```

    To fix it, explicitly define the return type:
    ```diff
     val funSpec = FunSpec.builder("foo")
    +  .returns(INT)
       .addStatement("return 1")
       .build()
    ```
    ```kotlin
    public fun foo(): Int = 1 // ✅
    ```

    Additionally, as part of this change, `FunSpec.returnType` has changed to be non-nullable. This is a source- and
    binary-compatible change, although if you were performing null-checks then new warnings may appear after upgrade.

 * Fix: Append nested class names to alias during name lookup (#1568).
 * Fix: Allow PropertySpec with context receivers and without getter or setter (#1575).

## Version 1.13.2

_2023-05-05_

Thanks to [@Squiry][Squiry] for contributing to this release.

* Fix: `KSType.toTypeName` fixed to work with aliased types (#1534).

## Version 1.13.1

Thanks to [@rickclephas][rickclephas] for contributing to this release.

 * Fix: Look at canonical names instead of just package names when generating import aliases (#1519).

## Version 1.11.0

_2022-03-24_

Thanks to [@liujingxing][liujingxing] and [@BoD][BoD] for contributing to this release.

* New: Kotlin scripting support in `FileSpec`.

```kotlin
val spec = FileSpec.scriptBuilder("Taco")
  .addStatement("println(%S)", "hello world!")

```

Generates a `Taco.kts` file with the following contents:

```kotlin
println("hello world!")
```

* New: Emit trailing commas for multi-line parameters and annotations.
* New: Add `KSAnnotation.toAnnotationSpec()`.
* New: Add `Unit` and `CharSequence` conversions in `javapoet-interop`.
* New: Add support for default imports in `FileSpec`.
  * This is particularly oriented at scripting support, but can also be used in non-script files.
* New: Update to Kotlin 1.6.10.

## Version 1.10.2

_2021-10-22_

Thanks to [@glureau][glureau] and [@goooler][goooler] for contributing to this release.

* Fix: Don't wrap type names inside line comments.
* Fix: Ignore Java's `@Deprecated` annotations on synthetic methods for annotations.

## Version 1.10.1

_2021-09-21_

Thanks to [@evant][evant] for contributing to this release.

 * Fix: Correct generation of typealiases with type args in KSP interop.

## Version 1.10.0

_2021-09-20_

Thanks to [@martinbonnin][martinbonnin], [@idanakav][idanakav], [@goooler][goooler], and
[@anandwana001][anandwana001] for contributing to this release.

 * New: Add a new [KSP][ksp] interop artifact. See [docs][ksp-interop-docs] for more details.
 * New: Add a new [JavaPoet][javapoet] interop artifact. See [docs][javapoet-interop-docs] for more
   details.

 * New: `TypeNameAliasTag` has been moved to KotlinPoet's main artifact under `TypeAliasTag`, for
   reuse with KSP interop.
 * `ImmutableKm*` classes have been removed. They were deemed to be a needless abstraction over the base `kotlinx-metadata` Km types. All usages of these should be substituted with their non-immutable base types.
 * Fix: Fix self-referencing type variables in metadata parsing.
 * Fix: Use delicate APIs rather than noisy logging ones when converting annotation mirrors in
   `AnnotationSpec.get`.

## Version 1.9.0

_2021-06-22_

   even if conflicting declarations are present in the same scope.
 * Fix: Escape member names that only contain underscores.
 * Fix: Always emit an empty primary constructor if it was set via `TypeSpec.primaryConstructor`.

## Version 1.8.0

_2020-10-20_

 * New: Detect expression bodies with `return·` and `throw·` prefixes.
 * Fix: Omit visibility modifiers on custom accessors.

## Version 1.7.1

_2020-10-15_

 * Fix: 1.7.0 was published using JDK 11 which set `"org.gradle.jvm.version"` to `"11"` in Gradle
   metadata, making it impossible to use the library on earlier Java versions (see
   [#999][issue-999]). 1.7.1 is published with JDK 8, which fixes the problem.

## Version 1.7.0

_2020-10-14_

 * New: Kotlin 1.4.10.
 * New: Generated code is now compatible with the [explicit API mode][explicit-api-mode] by default.
 * New: Escape soft and modifier keywords, in addition to hard keywords.
 * New: Improve enum constants generation for cleaner diffs.
 * New: Disallow setters on immutable properties.
 * New: Ensure trailing new lines in expression bodies.
 * New: Ensure trailing new lines after parameterless custom setters.
 * Fix: Don't auto-convert properties with custom accessors to primary constructor properties.
 * Fix: Don't allow parameterless setters with body.
 * Fix: Prevent auto-wrapping spaces inside escaped keywords.

## Version 1.6.0

_2020-05-28_

 * New: Deprecate Mirror API integrations.

   Mirror API integrations, such as `TypeElement.asClassName()` and
   `FunSpec.overriding(ExecutableElement)`, are being deprecated in this release. These KotlinPoet
   APIs are most often used in annotation processors. Since kapt runs annotation processors over
   stubs, which are Java files, a lot of the Kotlin-specific information gets lost in translation
   and cannot be accessed by KotlinPoet through the Mirror API integrations. Examples include:

   - Alias types, such as `kotlin.String`, get converted to their JVM representations, such as
     `java.lang.String`.
   - Type nullability information is not accessible.
   - `suspend` functions are seen as simple functions with an additional `Continuation` parameter.

   The correct solution is to switch to [KotlinPoet-metadata][kotlinpoet-metadata] or
   [KotlinPoet-metadata-specs][kotlinpoet-metadata-specs] API, which fetches Kotlin-specific
   information from the `@Metadata` annotation and produces correct KotlinPoet Specs. We may explore
   adding new metadata-based alternatives to the deprecated APIs in the future.

 * New: Kotlin 1.3.72.
 * New: Improve `MemberName` to support operator overloading.
 * New: Support generics in `AnnotationSpec`.
 * New: Add support for functional interfaces.
 * New: Make more `FunSpec.Builder` members public for easier mutation.
 * Fix: Properly propagate implicit type and function modifiers in nested declarations.
 * Fix: Properly escape type names containing `$` character.
 * Fix: Don't emit `LambdaTypeName` annotations twice.
 * Fix: Preserve tags in `TypeName.copy()`.

## Version 1.5.0

_2020-01-09_

 KotlinPoet now targets JDK8, which means that executing a build that includes KotlinPoet as a
 dependency on a machine with an older version of JDK installed won't work. **This has no effect on
 the code that KotlinPoet produces**: the code can still be compiled against JDK6, as long as it
 doesn't use any features that were introduced in newer releases.

 * New: Kotlin 1.3.61.
 * New: Add support for processing FileFacades in KotlinPoet-metadata.
 * New: Add support for inner nested and companion objects on annotation classes.

 * New: Tag `AnnotationSpec`s with the annotation mirror when available.
 * New: Include annotations on enum entries when creating `TypeSpec`s from metadata.
 * Fix: Fix metadata parsing for types.
 * Fix: Allow file names that are Kotlin keywords.
 * Fix: Properly escape type alias names with backticks.
 * Fix: Allow creating `TypeSpec`s with names that can be escaped with backticks.
 * Fix: Properly escape enum constant names with backticks.
 * Fix: Maintain proper ordering of properties and initializers when emitting a `TypeSpec`.
   **Note**: with this change, any properties declared after any initializer blocks will not be
   added to the primary constructor and will instead be emitted inside the `TypeSpec` body.
 * Fix: Don't emit a leading new line if type KDoc is empty but parameter KDocs are present.
 * Fix: Ensure KotlinPoet-metadata resolves package names properly.

 ## Version 1.4.4

_2019-11-16_

 * New: Add annotations support to `TypeAliasSpec`.
 * New: Read type annotations from Kotlin `Metadata`.
 * New: Introduce `ImmutableKmDeclarationContainer`.
 * Fix: Use full package name for shading `auto-common`.
 * Fix: Support reading self-type variables (e.g. `Asset<A : Asset<A>>`) from Kotlin `Metadata`.

## Version 1.4.0

_2019-09-24_

 * New: This release introduces the new KotlinPoet-metadata API that makes it easy to introspect
   Kotlin types and build KotlinPoet Specs based on that data.

   The strategy for type introspection is driven by `ClassInspector`, which is a basic interface for
   looking up JVM information about a given Class. This optionally is used by the
   `toTypeSpec()`/`toFileSpec()` APIs in `kotlinpoet-metadata-specs` artifact to inform about
   Classes with information that isn’t present in metadata (overrides, JVM modifiers, etc). There
   are two batteries-included implementations available in `ReflectiveClassInspector`
   (for reflection) and `ElementsClassInspector` (for the javax Elements API in annotation
   processing). These implementations are available through their respective
   `kotlinpoet-classinspector-*` artifacts. For more information refer to the
   [KotlinPoet-metadata-specs README][kotlinpoet-metadata-specs].

   At the time of this release the API is in experimental mode and has to be opted into via the
   `KotlinPoetMetadataPreview` annotation.

 * New: Kotlin 1.3.50.
 * New: A new constructor to simplify creation of `ParameterSpec` instances.
 * New: New `ClassName` constructors.

 * New: `FunSpec.Builder.clearBody()` helper method.
 * Fix: Properly escape enum constant names.
 * Fix: Ensure trailing newlines in KDoc and function bodies.
 * Fix: `TypeVariableName`s with empty bounds will now default to `Any?`.
 * Fix: Don't emit parens for primary constructors.
 * Fix: `ClassName`s with empty simple names are not allowed anymore.
